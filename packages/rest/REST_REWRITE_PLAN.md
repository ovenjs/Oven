# REST Class Rewrite Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to completely rewrite the REST class from scratch to integrate all the advanced features that have been implemented but are not currently being utilized.

## Current State Analysis
The current REST class only uses:
- Basic BucketManager for rate limiting
- Simple request/response handling with undici
- Basic event emission
- Simple error handling

However, we have implemented many advanced features that are not being used:
- Advanced caching system
- Connection pooling and HTTP client optimization
- Request batching and queuing
- Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Advanced debugging and logging
- Request/response transformation utilities
- Middleware pipeline system

## Rewrite Goals
1. **Integrate all advanced features** into the REST class
2. **Maintain backward compatibility** with the current API
3. **Improve performance** through proper utilization of implemented features
4. **Enhance developer experience** with better debugging and monitoring
5. **Ensure type safety** throughout the implementation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup
1. **Update REST Class Structure**
   - Import all required modules (cache, connection, monitoring, etc.)
   - Initialize all components in the constructor
   - Set up proper dependency injection between components

2. **Update Type Definitions**
   - Fix export issues in types/index.ts (RESTEvents vs RESTEventMap)
   - Ensure all types are properly exported and accessible
   - Create proper interfaces for the enhanced REST client

### Phase 2: Integrate Advanced Rate Limiting
1. **Enhanced Bucket Management**
   - Properly integrate the BucketManager with the request flow
   - Implement route-specific bucket identification
   - Add proper bucket lifecycle management

2. **Global Rate Limiting**
   - Implement proper global rate limit detection and handling
   - Add automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Emit proper rate limit events

### Phase 3: Add Caching System
1. **Request Caching**
   - Integrate the Cache system for GET requests
   - Implement cache key generation based on request parameters
   - Add cache invalidation strategies

2. **Cache Configuration**
   - Expose cache configuration options in RESTOptions
   - Implement TTL-based cache expiration
   - Add cache statistics and monitoring

### Phase 4: Connection Optimization
1. **Connection Pooling**
   - Integrate the ConnectionPool for HTTP connections
   - Configure connection reuse and keep-alive
   - Implement connection timeout handling

2. **HTTP Client Enhancement**
   - Use the enhanced HttpClient instead of direct undici calls
   - Implement request/response interception
   - Add proper connection error handling

### Phase 5: Request Batching
1. **Batch Processing**
   - Integrate the BatchProcessor for compatible requests
   - Implement automatic request batching when possible
   - Add batch configuration options

2. **Queue Management**
   - Implement priority-based request queuing
   - Add queue size limits and timeout handling
   - Emit queue-related events

### Phase 6: Advanced Error Handling
1. **Error Classification**
   - Integrate the ErrorHandler for proper error classification
   - Implement retry logic based on error types
   - Add circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures

2. **Retry Mechanisms**
   - Implement exponential backoff with jitter
   - Add retry condition configuration
   - Emit retry events for monitoring

### Phase 7: Performance Monitoring
1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Integrate the PerformanceMonitor for request metrics
   - Track request times, success rates, and error rates
   - Implement periodic metrics reporting

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add request timeout handling
   - Implement request cancellation
   - Add performance profiling capabilities

### Phase 8: Advanced Event System
1. **Event Enhancement**
   - Utilize the EventManager for proper event handling
   - Implement event batching for performance
   - Add event filtering and prioritization

2. **Debug Logging**
   - Integrate the Logger for structured logging
   - Implement log levels and filtering
   - Add request/response tracing

### Phase 9: Middleware Pipeline
1. **Request/Response Middleware**
   - Integrate the MiddlewarePipeline for request processing
   - Implement pre-request and post-response hooks
   - Add middleware for authentication, validation, etc.

2. **Transformation Utilities**
   - Integrate the Transformer for request/response transformation
   - Implement automatic data serialization/deserialization
   - Add data validation middleware

### Phase 10: Testing and Documentation
1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Update existing tests to work with the new implementation
   - Add integration tests for all new features
   - Implement performance benchmarks

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md with new features and examples
   - Create detailed API documentation
   - Add migration guide for existing users

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: Core Architecture and Rate Limiting (2 days)
- **Phase 3-4**: Caching and Connection Optimization (2 days)
- **Phase 5-6**: Batching and Error Handling (2 days)
- **Phase 7-8**: Monitoring and Events (2 days)
- **Phase 9-10**: Middleware and Finalization (2 days)

## Backward Compatibility
- Maintain the same public API surface
- Keep existing method signatures unchanged
- Ensure all existing functionality continues to work
- Add new features as opt-in configurations

## Success Metrics
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- All implemented features are utilized
- Performance improvement over current implementation
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear documentation and examples

## Risk Mitigation
- Implement features incrementally with proper testing
- Maintain feature flags for new functionality
- Create rollback plan in case of issues
- Monitor performance impact of each change
